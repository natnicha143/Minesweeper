	\subsection{Requirements}
	\par The current  version of minesweeper successfully meets the requirements of the traditional minesweeper game however it is still yet to implement the hexagon and colour-based minesweeper  modes successfully. 
		\subsubsection{List of completed requirements}
		Functionality associated with icons |
		The program is able to meet this requirements by accomplishing the following actions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The program shows whether a cell is covered or uncovered by clearly displaying the state of the buttons. The buttons possess a 3D-like image when unclicked, the colour of the buttons change once it is sunken (or clicked) into a darker contrast of the same colour. 
			\item When a cell with no adjacent mines is clicked, all adjacent cells alike are uncovered until it reaches a cell with adjacent mines. This task was done in a while loop, not recursively (as there was no need) as previously stated. 
			\item The state of the board, once the buttons are pressed, are represented by a 'backing grid' which assigns all cells with a number or mine, according to the randomly generated mines and its coordinates.
			\item The program displays whether a cell has a mine or not by representing it with an image of a mine when pressed and also displaying a message that the game is over.
		\end{itemize}
		
		Displaying icons |
		\par The program uses the tkinter module and its button component. This makes responding to left mouse click for icon display possible. The left click implementation for the flag is yet to be implemented. 
		
		Losing a game |
		\par When the user clicks on a button which reveals a mine, a message is displayed in the window "Game Over!" and the state of the game is disabled. 
		
		Difficulty |
		\par The user has the ability to select a difficulty: beginner, intermediate or advanced. When a difficulty is selected, it resets the board to that chosen difficulty. 
		
		Options |
		\par The user is able to start the game by selecting a difficulty and not a game mode, the program will default to the basic minesweeper game. Selecting the cross at the top right of the window will exit the program and window. The pause button is identified by the universal word "pause" and will disable the game and stop the timer until pressed again and the game is resumed.
		
		\subsubsection{Prioritized list of on-going requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The user is able to flag a cell that they believe is a mine.
			\item The scoring system of the game - the game timer. 
			\item The different game modes
		\end{itemize}	
	
	
	\subsection{Product Use Cases}
	\textbf{The following list itemizes the user requirements for the implementation of the Ladder-gram program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The user should be able to interact with the program by specifying the dictionary file name $($without the .txt extension$)$.
		\item The user should be able to interact with the program by specifying the source and target word.
		\item The user should be able to supply a list of words that cannot be used in the path solution by specifying the file name and placing it in the same directory as the program file.
		\item The user will have the option of choosing to evaluate the shortest path from source word to target word as the solution.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Software Architecture}
	\textbf{The following list itemizes the software requirements for the implementation of the Ladder-gram program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The program will notify the user if the inputs are invalid and the program will exit.
		\item The program will notify the user if a solution was found.
		\item If a valid solution is found the program will print it to the console along with the length of the solution.
		\item If the user chooses to input a list of banned words, the program will remove those words from the working dictionary. 
		\item The program will evaluate the shortest solution if the user requests.

		1.3 & Source word input contains special character. & Program displays error message: ``Input words cannot contain numbers or special characters" and system exits. & As expected. \\
		1.4 & Target word input contains number. & Program displays error message: ``Input words cannot contain numbers or special characters and system exits." & As expected. \\
		1.5 & Source and target words are the same. & System prints error: ``Start and target words cannot be the same." & As expected. \\
		1.6 & Target word input is of different length to source word. & System prints error message: ``Start and target words must be the same length." & As expected. \\
		1.7 & Check whether init function returns source and target word after input is validated. & Function returns source word as the first element in the list and target as second. & As expected.\\
		2.0 & \textbf{Test Helper Functions} &  &  \\
		2.1 & Test same function and whether it returns the correct number of identical letters. & Test case returns true if same function returns 4 for `lead' \& `lead', 3 for `lead' \& `mead' and false if `hello' \& `there' equals 0. & As expected. \\
